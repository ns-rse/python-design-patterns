# Python Design Patterns

A simple package consisting of example design-patterns to complement the blog [Design Patterns](https://ns-rse.github.io/design-patterns).

# Contributing

The intention is to use this as a learning resource for myself but if you wish to contribute feel free to fork and make a pull request. 
I use some linting tools via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to ensure code is consistent and write tests using [pytest](https://pytest.org)
to ensure each pattern actually works as expected.
