# Contributing

The intention is to use this as a learning resource for myself but if you wish to contribute feel free to fork and make
a pull request.  I use some linting tools via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to ensure code is consistent and
write tests using [pytest](https://pytest.org) to ensure each pattern actually works as expected.

If you want to contribute please fork the repository, clone it and then install all development tools and
install[`pre-commit`](https://www.pre-commit.com/) with...

``` bash
pip install -e .[tests]
pre-commit install
```
